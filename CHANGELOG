   statistics file

   background image

 - fix: setting "dist border px" to 0 still removed objects from border
 - fix: scikit-image methods could not be used for "binary threshold"
 - fix: set "image fix phase offset" to True by default, otherwise
   objects in the background cause a false offset

   - update tutorials with new CLI plots
   - add tutorial for background correction (#3)
0.4.1:
 - fix: extracted wrong phase image from SID4Bio data (qpformat 0.3.5) 
0.4.0
 - feat: ROI background correction supports masking of the
   imaged object via the "amplitude mask sphere" and
   "phase mask sphere" settings in the [bg] section.
 - setup: support qpimage>=0.4.0
 - tests: improve coverage
 - docs: minor update (#7)
0.3.3
 - ci: automate PyPI release with travis-ci
 - setup: bump versions of dependent packages
0.3.2
 - docs: update of introduction and minor changes
0.3.1
 - bump version because of regression fixed in qpformat 0.2.1
 - feat: flush statistics file during writing
0.3.0
 - drop support for Python 3.5

   starting at 0 while the CLI keeps using indices starting at 1
 - fix: hologram keyword arguments were not used for background
   correction
 - fix: case where index-based background correction does not work
 - feat: sphere analysis is picked up where left off in previous run
 - command line interface:
   - fix: allow white spaces for input data path argument
   - fix: improve verbosity of status messages
 - docs: add troubleshooting section
0.2.0
 - feat: reuse computed ROI data from previous runs
 - ref: update [roi] configuration key names to reflect pixel units:
   "dist border px", "exclude overlap px", "pad border px"
 - fix: improve verbosity of error messages
 - fix: config value "[roi] size variation" must be in interval [0,1]
 - fix: handle ROIs with failed edge detection in "dm_analyze_sphere"
0.1.4
 - feat: add local thresholding step before segmentation
 - fix: check number of qpimages in sensor_data.h5 during dm_convert
 - fix: "exclude overlap" only used for background image
 - fix: not possible to analyze phasics data folder when raw data
   is present (qpformat 0.1.5)
0.1.3
 - automatically fix inverted ranges when loading "roi_slices.txt"
 - remove "holo" section from drymass.cfg if not relevant
 - allow user-defined ROI selection via "[roi] enabled = False"
