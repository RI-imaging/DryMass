0.3.1
 - bump version because of regression fixed in qpformat 0.2.1
 - feat: flush statistics file during writing
0.3.0
 - drop support for Python 3.5
 - ref: background correction in convert.py uses background indices
   starting at 0 while the CLI keeps using indices starting at 1
 - fix: hologram keyword arguments were not used for background
   correction
 - fix: case where index-based background correction does not work
 - feat: sphere analysis is picked up where left off in previous run
 - command line interface:
   - fix: allow white spaces for input data path argument
   - fix: improve verbosity of status messages
 - docs: add troubleshooting section
0.2.0
 - feat: reuse computed ROI data from previous runs
 - ref: update [roi] configuration key names to reflect pixel units:
   "dist border px", "exclude overlap px", "pad border px"
 - fix: improve verbosity of error messages
 - fix: config value "[roi] size variation" must be in interval [0,1]
 - fix: handle ROIs with failed edge detection in "dm_analyze_sphere"
0.1.4
 - feat: add local thresholding step before segmentation
 - fix: check number of qpimages in sensor_data.h5 during dm_convert
 - fix: "exclude overlap" only used for background image
 - fix: not possible to analyze phasics data folder when raw data
   is present (qpformat 0.1.5)
0.1.3
 - automatically fix inverted ranges when loading "roi_slices.txt"
 - remove "holo" section from drymass.cfg if not relevant
 - allow user-defined ROI selection via "[roi] enabled = False"
 - added hologram analysis parameter tuning (qpimage 0.1.6)
 - added 2D model fitting to sphere analysis (qpsphere 0.1.4)
 - fixed `cfg_funcs.int_or_str`
0.1.2
 - allow to disable sensor image tif export
 - support input QPI data with different shapes
 - fixed wrong assumption about definition of dry mass in cells
   (water vs. intracellular salt solution)
 - allow to use separate file or series index for background correction
   with experimental data (#6)
 - small visualization improvements
0.1.1
 - add file name to image identifier and update plotting (#4)
 - renamed "object" to "identifier" in statistics output
 - binary-based background correction (manual or automated threshold)
