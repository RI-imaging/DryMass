What is DryMass?
----------------
DryMass is a software for quantitative phase imaging (QPI) analysis
with functionalities such as

- extraction of meta data (e.g. wavelength, acquisition time) from experimental data files,
- quantitative phase image background correction,
- determination of dry mass for biological cells, or
- extraction of refractive index and radius for spherical phase objects
  such as liquid droplets, microgel beads, or cells. 


Quantitative phase imaging
--------------------------
Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a 2D imaging technique that quantifies
the phase retardation of a wave traveling through a specimen.
For instance, digital holographic microscopy (DHM) :cite:`Kemper_2007` can be
used to record the quantitative phase image of biological cells, yielding the
optical density from which the :ref:`dry mass <section_theory_dry_mass>` or
the refractive index (RI) can be computed. Another example is electron holography
:cite:`Lehmann_2002` which can be used to visualize
`p-n junctions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction>`_
due to the different electronic potentials in the doped semiconductors. 
DryMass was designed for the analysis of single cells (typical units for distance [Âµm]
and wavelength [nm]), but the concepts used apply to both methods.
