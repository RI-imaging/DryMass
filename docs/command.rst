Command line interface
======================

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2


DryMass comes with a command line interface (CLI). To use the CLI,
a command shell is required, such as the command prompt
`Cmd.exe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe>`_ on Windows,
or `Terminal.app <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)>`_ on MacOS.
Please not that if DryMass is installed in a
`virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, then the
DryMass CLI is only available if this environment is activated.
